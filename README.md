# Server Ranks
This is a server ranking web application where minecraft server admins can post their minecraft servers and other users can vote.

This project is a remake of my initial server rankings webapp which used Angular 1, I chose to remake this project as I knew it would be an excellent opportunity to revise what I learnt the first time round about web development and that a project such as this covers lots of areas and has required a lot of time and dedication.

This web application uses express as the backend server and angular2 as the frontend web framework. MongoDb is used as the database with Mongoose as the ODM.

JSON web tokens are used to authenticate users, the JWT is generated by the backend once receiving valid credentials from the client and then the client uses this JWT after the inital 'login'

This project is currently just a prototype and is not entirely complete, there are still things to be completed:

1. Allowing users to upload images to my own server and storing and serving images preferably from a CDN

2. Improving validation of forms across the application

3. Improving and tidying up the code mainly with regards to error handling

4. Implementing a system whereby a user with a cookie can only vote a certain amount of times in a day
